## Stakeholders

Stakeholder Names:
- Kevin Ye (represents high school music students)
- Ray Ochotta (represents hobbyist musicians)
- Cara Rivecco (represents music teachers/professional musicians)

Goals:
- Obtain certifications for instruments (e.g. piano)
- Prepare for sightreading auditions
- Become a better musician
- Practice sightreading for substituting in full-length ensemble pieces
- Have a fun and engaging sightreading class activity

Problems:
- Practicing sightreading is inconvenient
- Books or computers are required for sightreading
- The difficulty doesn't scale, so as you get better you need to buy more books
- A large number of exercises are needed to not reuse sightreading pieces
- Finding pieces off of the internet can be disorganized and lack targeting
- Existing sight reading practice pieces are often shorter than real-life sightreading situations

Needs:
- Ability to adjust difficulty
- Ability to playback sample of music you played
- Ability to automatically grade performance
- Ability to focus on specific techniques
- Large amount of possible sightreading samples
- Varied styles of sightreading material (soloist vs ensemble, symphony vs jazz, etc.)

## Product Vision Statement

We hope to create a product that makes sightreading more accessible to everyone, from the beginner to the master, by providing excerpts of real pieces of varying styles with customizable difficulty and providing feedback to our users, eliminating some of the major inconvenience in practicing sightreading. 

## User Requirements

- As a music teacher, I want to pull random excerpts of music, so I can help my students practice.
- As a piano player, I want to practice more pieces in F# major, so I can more easily learn future pieces in that key.
- As a parent, I want to give automatically generated feedback, so my child can improve even when I'm not there to help.
- As a hobbyist guitarist, I want to play more pieces in general, so I can build intuition for how the guitar works.
- As a drummer, I want to be more familiar with triplets, so I need to select music that features triplets.
- As a substitute instrumentalist, I need a way to practice sight reading full length symphonies, so I can be ready to play unfamiliar orchestra pieces
- As a auditioning musician, I need to be able to randomly select pieces to sight read, so I can simulate my audition
- As a new musician who does not know how to sight read, I want to start with simple practices so that I can better practice my skills.
- As a music student who is improving, I need to be able to modulate the difficulty of my exercises, so the music can follow my growth.
- As a freelance musician, I need to be able to choose which type of music to practice sightreading, so I can play many different styles of music.
- As a musician who wants to save money, I want to not have to buy lots of different sight reading books, so I need a large volume of music to read.
- As a musician, I want to make sure that I am on tempo, so I need a metronome functionality.
