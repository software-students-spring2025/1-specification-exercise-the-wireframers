## Stakeholders

Stakeholder Names:
- Kevin Ye
- Ray Ochotta

Goals:
- Obtain certifications for instruments (e.g. piano)
- Prepare for sightreading auditions
- Become a better musician

Problems:
- Practicing sightreading is inconvenient
- Books are required for sightreading
- The difficulty doesn't scale, so as you get better you need to buy more books
- A large number of exercises are needed

Needs:
- Ability to automatically adjust difficulty
- Ability to playback sample of music you played
- Ability to focus on specific techniques
- Large amount of possible sightreading samples

## Product Vision Statement

We hope to create a product that makes sightreading more accessible to everyone, from the beginner to the master, by providing excerpts of real pieces of varying styles with customizable difficulty and providing feedback to our users, eliminating some of the major inconvenience in practicing sightreading. 

## User Requirements

As a music teacher, I want to generate random excerpts of music, so I can help my students practice.
As a piano player, I want to practice more pieces in F# major, so I can more easily learn future pieces in that key.
As a parent, I want to give automatically generated feedback, so my child can improve even when I'm not there to help.
As a hobbyist guitarist, I want to play more pieces in general, so I can build intuition for how the guitar works.
As a drummer, I want to practice exercises with triplets, so I am more familiar with their rhythm.
As a substitute instrumentalist, I need a way to practice sight reading full length symphonies, so I can be ready to play unfamiliar orchestra pieces
As a auditioning musician, I need to be able to randomly select pieces to sight read, so I can simulate my audition
As a new musician who does not know how to sight read, I want to start with simple practices so that I can better practice my skills.
As a music student who is improving, I need to be able to modulate the difficulty of my exercises, so the music can follow my growth.
As a freelance musician, I need to be able to choose which type of music to practice sightreading, so I can play many different styles of music.
